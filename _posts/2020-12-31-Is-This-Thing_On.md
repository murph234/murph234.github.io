title: Weekend Ramble - Been a While

Tap, tap, is this thing on?

Realized it's been quite a while since I've posted anything, so thought maybe I'd 
squeeze one in before the end of the year (hey, got 8 hours still!).  So, hi!  Lots going
on, including having one daughter graduate college and another start and then transfer for
her junior year.  Odd not having teenagers any more...  Family is good, and work is
interesting and going well.  Got some projects in the queue, and if I'm not totally
lame I'll start posting them here.

And oh yeah, there's that pandemic thing, you may have heard about it.  Lots written
about it as we approach year 3, so I don't have a lot to add, but here are a few
quick points:

- Vaccines work and are safe.  Get them.
- Masks help too.  Wear a good one, and cover your effing nose people! (had to get that out)
- People, learn some statistics will you?

Ok, rant over, such as it was.  Next post should be sooner than 2025!
